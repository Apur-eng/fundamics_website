# Fundemics Tutorials Website

## 1. Project Overview

Fundemics Tutorials is the institutional website for **Fundemics Tutorials LLP**, a premier academic coaching institute established in Lucknow (operational since 2014, officially incorporated under the LLP Act in 2018).

- **Who it is for**: Students and parents across Classes I through XII enrolled under the ICSE (Classes I–X), ISC (Classes XI–XII), CBSE (Classes I–XII), and Uttar Pradesh State Board curricula in Lucknow, with specialized academic batches for City Montessori School (CMS) scholars.
- **What it accomplishes**: 
  - Establishes academic credibility through 100% verified board examination rankers, subject distinction records, and official certifications (ISO 9001:2015 & MCA Government Incorporation).
  - Clarifies academic pathways across primary, middle, secondary, and senior secondary tiers.
  - Demonstrates the institute's teaching methodology ("The Fundemics Method").
  - Connects parents and students directly with admissions coordinators via structured enquiry forms, one-click phone calls (`tel:+917617018888`), and instant WhatsApp messaging (`https://wa.me/917617018888`).

## 2. Technology Stack

The application is built as a fast, statically deliverable Single Page Application (SPA) using:

- **Core Framework**: React 19 (`react: ^19.2.8`, `react-dom: ^19.2.8`) with TypeScript (`typescript: ~6.0.2`).
- **Build Tool & Bundler**: Vite 8 (`vite: ^8.3.0`) with `@vitejs/plugin-react`. Custom Rollup chunking divides code into dedicated vendor, icons, and application bundles.
- **Styling Architecture**: Vanilla CSS with CSS Custom Properties (Tokens) for consistent design language. Zero utility CSS frameworks (Tailwind is intentionally not used). Design tokens are organized in `src/styles/tokens.css`, with global resets and layout rules in `src/styles/globals.css`.
- **Iconography**: Lucide React (`lucide-react: ^1.46.0`) for lightweight, consistent SVG icons.
- **Routing**: Internal hash/pushState-compatible React Router Context (`src/context/RouterContext.tsx`) with zero heavy third-party routing dependencies.
- **SEO & Social Meta**: Custom `<SeoHead />` component managing document titles, canonical URLs, Open Graph tags, and structured JSON-LD schemas.
- **Linter**: Oxlint (`oxlint: ^1.81.0`) for fast static analysis.

## 6. Rankers / Results System

### Student Data Structure
All student ranker records reside in `src/data/rankersData.ts`. Each student record follows the `RankerRecord` interface:

```typescript
export interface RankerRecord {
  id: string;                      // Unique identifier e.g. "isc-2025-01"
  name: string;                    // Student full name
  board: 'ICSE' | 'ISC' | 'CBSE' | 'STATE BOARD';
  class: 'Class X' | 'Class XII'; // Normalized class
  className?: string;              // Optional alternate formatting
  year: string;                    // Academic session e.g. "2025–26", "2024–25"
  overallPercentage?: number | null;// Overall percentage e.g. 98.6
  percentileOrScore?: string;      // Formatted display string e.g. "98.6%"
  school?: string;                 // School name e.g. "City Montessori School, Lucknow"
  stream?: string;                 // e.g. "Science (PCM)", "Commerce"
  subjectScores?: Array<{          // Itemized subject scores
    subject: string;
    marks: number;
    maxMarks?: number;
  }>;
  image?: string;                  // Path from /public e.g. "/assets/rankers/student_name.png"
  achievementBadge?: string;       // e.g. "School Topper", "99 in Mathematics"
  isHistoricalArchive?: boolean;   // true for older archive records (2019–2023)
}
```

### Filtering Mechanics
- **Board Filter**: Toggles between `ALL`, `ICSE`, `ISC`, and `CBSE`.
- **Class Filter**: Dynamically extracts available classes from the active board data. Automatically resets to `ALL` if the current class isn't offered in the selected board.
- **Session Filter**: Dynamically extracts available academic years (e.g. `2025–26`, `2024–25`, `2023–24`).
- **Results Count**: Real-time counter updates with matching candidate count.

### 3D Perspective Card Carousel (`RankerCarousel.tsx` & `DeckCard.tsx`)
- High-performing students (sorted descending by `overallPercentage`) are arranged in an infinite-wrapping or clamped perspective carousel.
- Center card is elevated with interactive hover tilt, displaying student photograph, percentage badge, board badge, and school.
- Keyboard navigation (ArrowLeft / ArrowRight) and touch swipe gestures are supported with touch momentum dampening.

### Image Handling
- Photographs are stored as PNGs in `public/assets/rankers/`.
- The `<StudentImage />` component handles fallback initials/monograms gracefully if an image is missing or fails to load.

### How to Add a New Student Record
Add an object to the `rankersData` array in `src/data/rankersData.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 'isc-2026-new-candidate',
  name: 'Candidate Name',
  board: 'ISC',
  class: 'Class XII',
  year: '2025–26',
  overallPercentage: 97.4,
  percentileOrScore: '97.4%',
  school: 'City Montessori School, Gomti Nagar',
  stream: 'Science (PCM)',
  subjectScores: [
    { subject: 'Physics', marks: 98 },
    { subject: 'Mathematics', marks: 99 },
    { subject: 'Chemistry', marks: 95 },
  ],
  image: '/assets/rankers/candidate_name.png',
  achievementBadge: '99 in Mathematics',
},
```

## 7. Learning for Every Stage

Implemented in `src/components/home/CoursesSection.tsx`:

- **Board Switcher**: Horizontal tabs for **ICSE**, **CBSE**, and **STATE BOARD**.
- **Interactive State**: Clicking a board tab updates `activeBoardId`, transitioning the board description, official curriculum logo (`cisce_logo.jpeg`, `cbse_logo.jpeg`, `up_logo.webp`), and board-specific stages.
- **Academic Stages Rendered for Each Board**:
  1. **Primary**: Classes I–V (curiosity, foundational numeracy and reading)
  2. **Middle**: Classes VI–VIII (analytical thinking and basic proofs)
  3. **Secondary**: Classes IX–X (rigorous board exam preparation, precision testing)
  4. **Senior Secondary**: Classes XI–XII (in-depth Science/Commerce, derivations, entrance alignment)

---

## 8. The Fundemics Method

Implemented in `src/components/home/WhyChooseFundemics.tsx` under the heading *"The difference is in how we teach"*.

It defines 4 core pedagogical principles:
1. **01 ATTENTION — Small Batches**: Limited batch sizes ensuring every student participates and receives one-on-one attention.
2. **02 DIRECTION — Board-Focused Learning**: Curriculum aligned directly with ICSE, ISC, CBSE, and State Board syllabi.
3. **03 MEASUREMENT — Continuous Assessment**: Weekly checkpoints, unit tests, and performance reviews to identify gaps early.
4. **04 CONTINUITY — Beyond the Classroom**: 24/7 LMS access, curated revision notes, attendance monitoring, and parent communication.

**Interaction Model**:
- **Desktop (>= 1024px)**: Two-column layout. The right column displays an interactive timeline of the 4 principles with active vertical indicator bars. Clicking or hovering changes the active stage, triggering a smooth crossfade of the left graphic visual container and stage watermark.
- **Mobile (< 1024px)**: Stacked editorial card panels with synchronized progress pills (`STAGE 01 / 04`) that update on scroll.

---

## 9. Teachers

Implemented in `src/components/home/TeachersSection.tsx` and `src/pages/TeachersPage.tsx`:

### Leadership & Founders
- **Mayank Aggarwal**: Founder & Director, Head of Physics & Mathematics. Real photo: `/assets/mayank_aggarwal.jpeg`.
- **Manish K. Verma**: Co-Founder & Senior Mentor, B.Tech & M.Tech from IIT Dhanbad. Real photo: `/assets/manish_k_verma.jpeg`.

### Faculty Directory & Department Structure
The full faculty list is structured in `src/data/teachers.ts` across 10 departments:
1. Strategic Planning
2. Biology
3. Social Sciences
4. Mathematics
5. Physics
6. Operations & Support Team
7. Chemistry
8. Computer Science
9. Commerce
10. Pre-Primary

### Non-Permanent / Visiting Faculty Representation
Faculty members without an individual photo display an institutional monogram avatar generated from their initials (e.g. `MK` for Mohit Kumar) styled with deep navy and emerald accents via `<TeacherCard />`.

---

## 10. Assets & Data Architecture

### Canonical Asset Storage Structure
All active static assets are centralized in `public/assets/` and served directly by the web server:
- **Brand & Institutional Identity**:
  - `public/assets/LOGO.png` — Official Fundemics Tutorials LLP logo
  - `public/assets/cbse_logo.jpeg` — Central Board of Secondary Education crest
  - `public/assets/cisce_logo.jpeg` — Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations crest (1600x1031)
  - `public/assets/up_logo.webp` — Uttar Pradesh Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad State Board crest
- **Faculty Leadership Photography**:
  - `public/assets/mayank_aggarwal.jpeg` — Authentic portrait of Er. Mayank Aggarwal (Founder & Academic Director)
  - `public/assets/manish_k_verma.jpeg` — Authentic portrait of Er. Manish K. Verma (Co-Founder & Senior Mentor, IIT Dhanbad)
- **Official Legal & Quality Accreditations**:
  - `public/assets/fundamics_iso_page_1.png` & `fundamics_iso.pdf` — ISO 9001:2015 Certification
  - `public/assets/fundamics_certification_page_1.png` & `fundamics_certification.pdf` — Ministry of Corporate Affairs LLP Incorporation
- **Authentic Campus & Student Photography**:
  - `public/assets/cms_focused.webp` — Authentic photograph of CMS students in focused classroom discussion
- **Canonical Student Ranker Photographs**:
  - `public/assets/rankers/` — 49 verified individual student photographs matching the 49 canonical records in `src/data/rankersData.ts` on a strict 1-to-1 basis.
  - File naming convention:
    - ICSE / ISC: `[first_name]_[last_name].png` (e.g. `rudransh_singh.png`, `anamika_singh.png`, `chaitanya_kashyap.png`)
    - CBSE: `cbse_[first_name]_[last_name].png` (e.g. `cbse_shreya_srivastava.png`, `cbse_divyanshi_tiwari.png`)

---

### Data Storage & Single Sources of Truth
The application maintains absolute separation between UI view components and structured domain data:

| Domain Area | Canonical Data File | Interfaces Defined | Consumers Across Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Student Rankers & Board Results** | `src/data/rankersData.ts` | `RankerRecord`, `SubjectScore`, `BoardType` | `HomePage` (`FeaturedTopperCarousel` → `RankerCarousel`), `RankersPage` (`RankerHero`, `RankerFilters`, `RankerCard`, `RankerCarousel`, `IscAchievementArchive`) |
| **Faculty & Leadership Roster** | `src/data/teachers.ts` | `Teacher`, `DepartmentCategory` | `HomePage` (`TeachersSection`), `TeachersPage` (`TeacherCard`, Department Filters) |
| **Physical Coaching Branches** | `src/data/branches.ts` | `Branch` | `HomePage` (`CentresSection`), `QueriesPage` (branch selector dropdown), `Footer` |
| **Institutional Contact & Channels** | `src/data/siteConfig.ts` | `SiteConfig` | `Navbar`, `Footer`, `FinalContactCTA`, `WhatsAppFloatingButton`, `QueriesPage` |
| **Navigation Menus** | `src/data/navigation.ts` | `NavLink` | `Navbar` (desktop & mobile drawer), `Footer` (column links) |

---

### Shared Data Consumption Flow
1. **Homepage & Rankers Page Share the Exact Same Dataset**:
   There are **never** separate datasets for the homepage and the results page.
   - `HomePage.tsx` mounts `<FeaturedTopperCarousel />`, which renders `<RankerCarousel />`.
   - `<RankerCarousel />` directly imports `rankersData` from `src/data/rankersData.ts`, automatically sorting students by overall percentage (`overallPercentage`).
   - `RankersPage.tsx` imports the identical `rankersData`, powering the top statistics counters, multi-criteria filtering (Board, Class, Session), and the ISC Historical Archive.
   - Any update made to `src/data/rankersData.ts` instantly reflects on both the Homepage and the Rankers Page.
2. **Faculty Data Sharing**:
   - `HomePage.tsx` features leadership profiles from `src/data/teachers.ts`.
   - `TeachersPage.tsx` renders all 10 academic departments from the same file with department-level filtering and initials-based institutional monograms for faculty without portraits.

---

### How to Add a New Student / Board Result
1. **Prepare Photograph**:
   - Save the authentic student photo into `public/assets/rankers/[first_name]_[last_name].png` (or with `cbse_` prefix for CBSE).
   - Recommended size: 300x300 to 600x600 px, optimized PNG or WebP under 150 KB.
2. **Add Record to `src/data/rankersData.ts`**:
   Append a new `RankerRecord` object to the `rankersData` array:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 'isc-xii-2627-new-student',
     name: 'Full Student Name',
     uid: '8199999', // Optional CISCE/CBSE Roll or UID
     batch: 2027,
     year: '2026–27',
     session: '2026–27',
     school: 'Full Official School Name',
     board: 'ISC', // 'ICSE' | 'ISC' | 'CBSE' | 'STATE BOARD'
     className: 'Class XII',
     class: 'Class XII',
     overallPercentage: 98,
     percentage: 98,
     formattedPercentage: '98%',
     subjectResults: [
       { subject: 'Physics', percentage: 99 },
       { subject: 'Mathematics', percentage: 98 },
     ],
     image: '/assets/rankers/new_student.png',
     isPlaceholder: false,
   }
   ```
3. **Verify**:
   The session filter on `/rankers` automatically discovers the new session string (`'2026–27'`) and creates the corresponding filter pill. The student automatically enters the Homepage carousel if their score qualifies.

---

### How to Add a New Faculty Member
1. Open `src/data/teachers.ts`.
2. Add an entry into `teachersData` under the appropriate `category`:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 'math-new-faculty',
     name: 'Faculty Name',
     role: 'Senior Faculty',
     subject: 'Mathematics',
     category: 'Mathematics',
     experience: '8+ Years Experience',
     education: 'M.Sc. Mathematics, University of Lucknow',
     image: '/assets/new_faculty.jpeg', // Optional: omit or set undefined for monogram
   }
   ```
3. If no photo is provided, leave `image` undefined; `<TeacherCard />` automatically generates a stylized monogram avatar from their initials.

---

### How to Replace an Image
1. Ensure the new image has the identical filename and is placed in `public/assets/` or `public/assets/rankers/`.
2. Or, if using a new filename, update the `image` field in `src/data/rankersData.ts` or `src/data/teachers.ts`.
3. Clear browser cache or trigger a Vite rebuild to view the updated asset.

---

### Verified Assets Removed as Duplicates
During the consolidation audit, all files were verified using SHA-256 content hashing. Redundant duplicate copies were safely removed:
1. **Root Loose Image Duplicates** (removed from root because canonical copies exist in `public/assets/`):
   - `cbse_logo.jpeg` → Canonical: `public/assets/cbse_logo.jpeg`
   - `cms_focused.webp` → Canonical: `public/assets/cms_focused.webp`
   - `Manish K.Verma.jpeg` → Canonical: `public/assets/manish_k_verma.jpeg`
   - `Mayank Aggarwal.jpeg` → Canonical: `public/assets/mayank_aggarwal.jpeg`
   - `UP_logo.webp` → Canonical: `public/assets/up_logo.webp`
   - `cisce_logo.jpeg` → Canonical: `public/assets/cisce_logo.jpeg`
2. **Redundant Duplicate Ranker Photos** (removed from `public/assets/rankers/`):
   - `isc_anamika_singh.png` (SHA-256 duplicate of `anamika_singh.png`)
   - `isc_neharika_singh.png` (SHA-256 duplicate of `neharika_singh.png`)
   - `isc_om_srivastava.png` (SHA-256 duplicate of `om_srivastava.png`)
   - `isc_rudransh_singh.png` (SHA-256 duplicate of `rudransh_singh.png`)
   - `isc_urvi_singh.png` (SHA-256 duplicate of `urvi_singh.png`)
   - `isc_varnit_shukla.png` (SHA-256 duplicate of `varnit_shukla.png`)
   - Normalized filenames: `isc_chaitanya_kashyap.png` → `chaitanya_kashyap.png`, `isc_aniyan_singh.png` → `aniyan_singh.png`, `isc_shreya_pandey.png` → `shreya_pandey.png`.
3. **Unused Vite Template Assets**:
   - `src/assets/hero.png`, `src/assets/react.svg`, `src/assets/vite.svg` (and removed empty directory `src/assets/`).

## 12. Responsive Behaviour

The site uses a fluid, mobile-first design strategy without third-party grid frameworks:

- **Desktop (>= 1024px)**:
  - 2-column editorial layouts with side-by-side sticky timelines (The Fundemics Method, CMS Batches, More Than Just Classes).
  - 3D perspective DeckCard carousel with expansive horizontal spacing.
  - Fixed horizontal navbar with direct action buttons.
- **Tablet (640px – 1023px)**:
  - Flexbox and CSS Grid adapt from multi-column to stacked 2-column or single-column.
  - Carousel card widths adjust dynamically (`stepWidth = 220px`).
- **Mobile (< 640px)**:
  - Single-column vertical stacks.
  - Navigation converts into a full-screen slide drawer with backdrop blur.
  - Carousel switches to touch-optimized swiping (`stepWidth = 170px`).
  - Mobile quick-call bar fixed at viewport bottom on key enquiry pages.
  - Typography uses fluid `clamp()` formulas (e.g. `clamp(2.5rem, 6vw, 4.2rem)`) to prevent overflow.

## 13. Important Interactions

1. **Ranker Carousel**:
   - Touch drag / swipe with pointer capture.
   - Arrow keys (`ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`) for accessible navigation.
   - Dynamic 3D card elevation based on distance from active center index.
2. **Ranker Modal**:
   - Clicking any student card opens a detailed score breakdown modal.
   - Accessible Escape-key listener and backdrop click to close.
3. **Board Selection Tabs**:
   - Animated tab switching with accessible ARIA tablist roles.
4. **Interactive Differentiators Timeline**:
   - Scroll-synchronized vertical progress bar in `WhatMakesDifferent.tsx`.
5. **Certificate PDF Viewer**:
   - Clicking any certification opens a preview modal with full resolution certificate view and direct PDF download link.

## 14. Adding New Content

### Adding a New Student
1. Place student portrait in `public/assets/rankers/student_name.png`.
2. Add a new `RankerRecord` in `src/data/rankersData.ts`.

### Adding a New Academic Result Session
1. Add new student records with the session tag (e.g. `year: "2026–27"`).
2. The session filter on `/rankers` will automatically detect the new year and render a filter pill.

### Adding a New Faculty Member
1. Add an entry to `teachersData` in `src/data/teachers.ts` under the appropriate `category`.
2. If a photograph is available, place it in `public/assets/` and set `image: '/assets/filename.jpeg'`.
3. If no photo is available, leave `image` undefined; the card automatically renders a stylized monogram.

### Updating Contact Information
1. Open `src/data/siteConfig.ts`.
2. Update phone numbers, WhatsApp numbers, email, or LMS links. All components consuming `siteConfig` update automatically.

## 15. Development & Maintenance Notes

- **Single Source of Truth**:
  - Student results: `src/data/rankersData.ts` (Never add mock ranker files).
  - Faculty: `src/data/teachers.ts`.
  - Site metadata & phones: `src/data/siteConfig.ts`.
  - Physical branches: `src/data/branches.ts`.
- **CSS Architecture**: Modify variables in `src/styles/tokens.css` to update global spacing, typography scales, or colors. Avoid hardcoding random hex values.
- **Performance Sensitivity**: The topper carousel in `src/components/results/RankerCarousel.tsx` handles fast animation frames and touch events; avoid heavy state updates inside animation loops.
- **Routing**: Internal routing uses `src/context/RouterContext.tsx`. Use `<Link href="/path">` rather than native `<a href="/path">` for internal client-side navigation.

---

## 16. Deployment

- **Hosting Platform**: Vercel.
- **Vercel Config**: `vercel.json` provides:
  - SPA URL rewrites (`"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html"`).
  - HTTP Security Headers (HSTS, Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options).
  - 1-year immutable caching for static assets in `/assets/`.
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`).
- **Build Output**: `dist/`.
